# ProjectSPH — Personal Task Manager 🗂️

This is my personal task manager project, developed with the Python backend framework **Django** 🐍. It's the first step of a journey that just began.

## ✨ Motivation

The main purpose of this project is to control my personal tasks. I know there are already many apps for that, but I wanted to create my own version.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Backend: Django (Python) 🐍
- Database: (to be decided) 🗄️

## 🚧 Status

This README will be updated while I work on the project 👍
